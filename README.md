# Sentiment-Analysis-to-Select-Revelant-Emoticons

In this project, we classify a face based on the emotions and expressions shown and then
display the relative emoji. We used the FER2013 dataset to train our Convolutional Neural
Network which consisted of approximately 25000 images consisting of various human faces
showing a variety of emotions. Using this, our CNN is trained to recognize a varying degree
of emotion and hence generate the required emoticon. The Keras API was used as an interface
for the Tensorflow Library.

The Project was done by **Irine Sara Benoy**, **Justin Sunil David** and **Tauqir Waqar**
